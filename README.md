# Notiffy 1.0

Notiffy is an ultra-minimalist notification app for Windows.

The interface consists of a single text box.

Everything in the text box that isn't a notification definition is treated as comment.

Notification definitions are entered as follows:

> 2024.04.29 18:00 ------- This notification will appear only once on April 29th at 6:00 pm and will display this exact text.

> 1900.01.01 06:00 xxxxx-- This notification will appear every Monday to Friday at 6:00 am, starting from January 1st, 1900 (essentially forever).

> 1900.01.01 17:00 ----x-- Friday! This notification will appear every Friday at 5:00 pm (again, essentially forever).

If the notification definition is highlighted in green, it means it is formatted properly.

That's all!
